Carbon Gap,"London, England, United Kingdom",1 week ago,188 applicants,Data analyst ‚Äì Carbon Removal Ecosystem,"THE ROLECarbon Gap is the only environmental NGO in Europe dedicated solely to independent research and advocacy for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), with the largest number of CDR-focused policy professionals. Launched in 2021 at COP26, we have quickly established ourselves as a leading voice in the CDR policy advocacy arena, realised through the scientific research, synthesis, and analysis which underpin our policy positions.¬†Since launch, we have published a series of influential papers, our experts have been featured in the mainstream and climate media, and our Policy Directors have been selected as advisors to the policy making establishment. We are at the very start of a decades-long mission to help Europe realize its potential as a global carbon removal leader, and to deliver the CDR capacity necessary to meet Europe‚Äôs net zero commitment and global climate goals. Central to this mission is the ability to make sense of complex data in ways that are clear and convincing to policymakers, civil servants, and the climate-engaged public.As a¬†Data analyst, you will join Carbon Gap‚Äôs Research Team in building Carbon Gap‚Äôs expertise on the emerging field of carbon removal, while supporting the advocacy work needed to bridge the ambition gap on CDR. You‚Äôll work daily with established and respected experts in the field with frequent exposure to other climate leaders across government, industry, and academia.This is a rare opportunity for a data scientist or quantitative analyst who wants to apply their quantitative skills for real-world impact. The analyses you conduct will feed directly into our advocacy and education work, all in service of increasing European climate change mitigation efforts. Numbers speak volumes in the EU, and we need to turn up the volume when it comes to demanding more action on climate change and - in our particular focus area - carbon removal.¬†We are looking for an analyst who believes in the power of policy to enact climate action, is a self-possessed researcher able to spot opportunities for impact, is able to conceptualise, pitch and execute research projects independently, possesses excellent quantitative skills (e.g., Excel, and perhaps proficient in a programming language), and who has a willingness to experiment with new productivity technology. Most importantly, you will become an integral part of our small, pan-European Carbon Gap team. This would be a perfect role for a data analyst or data scientist in the early years of their career. We will help to get you a great grounding in the areas of climate, environment, and policy issues. Carbon Gap is a ripe platform for you to grow professionally, exposing you to research, policy, and business concepts and helping you build a wide network across the carbon removal and climate fields.RESPONSIBILITIESAs the first dedicated data analyst within our team, you will:Take the lead in conceptualising and implementing the necessary tools and working practices to support your own work, and to allow other members of the team to assist you and collaborate with you¬†Have the desire and ability to pose questions in data rather than using data to fit an existing conclusionWhere relevant, embrace cutting-edge productivity tools and research strategies, including advances in machine learning and generative AI to enable you to work smarter, not harderDive deep into CDR-related research topics spanning climate science, policy, and economic markets. Be resourceful and relentless in sourcing the data you need from a mixture of academic, public, private, and self-generated sources. Areas you will need to delve into include:Established and nascent CDR methods (spanning ‚Äúcarbon farming‚Äù methods like peatland rewetting to novel approaches such as direct air capture, enhanced rock weathering, and long-term incorporation of carbon into the built environment), their efficiency, resource requirements, monitoring, reporting and verification methods, social, cultural, economic and environmental implications, and governance¬†Existing policies in the EU, UK, and other jurisdictionsNon-governmental initiatives establishing governance, standards, and certifications for carbon removalThe commercial market for carbon removal, including technical developments in the fieldRole of CDR in broader climate actionCreate clear outputs (reports, figures, posts) that tell compelling stories based on your research output, including summaries and internal briefings.Write, edit, and contribute to the creation of outward-facing reports, policy briefs, and white papers, as well as other pieces of content such as social media and blog posts. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with the members of our Communications team.Be prepared to interview stakeholders in the field to add depth to your reports and enhance your data setsBe an active member of our mission and be always searching for new insights within the organization, and ways to add value to our policy asks including horizon scanning, and remaining curious about the challenges we face on our missionYOUR PROFILEYou have studied to graduate level, or in lieu of a graduate program can elaborate on how 3-4 years of experience in¬†a research and analysis-heavy role¬†has prepared you.

Previous projects or publications related to climate change would be a plus.You are creative, savvy, and have a clear ability to solve problems.¬†You are happy to autonomously conduct quantitative analysis, identify pertinent research questions, design robust methodologies suited to the research question, source relevant datasets, clean and manipulate datasets to reach conclusions, and have an ability to interpret findings to highlight key insights and trends.¬†¬†You obsess over Excel models, and hold a high degree of proficiency with data visualisation, modeling and statistical methods.¬†You are committed to climate action.¬†You can demonstrate previous work and passion for any area of climate, environmental or sustainability communications and action. You don‚Äôt need to be an expert in carbon removal, but you do need to understand the broad aspects of science and ideally demonstrate knowledge of key areas such as handling units of conversion in your models.¬†You‚Äôre comfortable with new material.¬†Diving into a new field, learning a new lexicon and core concepts, and digesting scientific papers doesn‚Äôt scare you. You want to become a master of new ideas and concepts.You make complicated things simple.¬†You have a knack for understanding big, complex issues and distilling them into what your audience needs to know, especially through writing or data visualization.You obsess about the bigger picture.¬†You‚Äôre not satisfied unless your work leads to tangible results, and always want to know how what you‚Äôre doing now serves the long-term goal.You‚Äôre a relationship-builder at heart.¬†You proactively make and maintain genuine connections, always looking for ways to help, and work well with diverse groups of people.In your cover letter, short paragraphs on the following areas of emphasis would help us to assess your application better:Your understanding of or experience¬†with delivering analysis-informed insights to policymakers, in any regionExamples of published work or other peer reviewed publications¬†‚Äì we‚Äôd love to see examples of your work.

This is because we want the best people for our roles and we recognise that sometimes those people aren‚Äôt available full-time.Contract type: PermanentClosing date: 21 February 2024Contact details for an Informal Discussion: Abi Latinwo, Team Leader Performance & Coordination, via email: alatinwo@westminster.gov.ukAbout UsTHE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF MOHAMAD‚ÄôS CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLSPublic Protection & Licensing in Westminster City Council is a world of extraordinary stories. Where people are passionate about keeping our streets safe and clean.Take Mohamad, a City Inspector who looks after the Little Venice ward. No two days are the same for Mohamad when he's out and about conducting ward inspections. He could be doing a licensing premises inspection one day and advising businesses and residents on the proper way to handle their waste on another. But before he joined Westminster, he used to work in banking, where he honed his skills in customer service and people management.And those skills matters because, while he occasionally needs to enforce the law, his job is mostly about building strong relationships: educating businesses and residents about the impact of certain enviro-crimes.One day he came across some unmarked commercial waste dumped on Edgware Road. Following procedures, he investigated this waste, carefully collecting evidence. Yet, despite his attempts to make contact with the commercial premises, the owners wouldn‚Äôt cooperate. Digging deeper, he worked collaboratively with different Westminster departments such as businesses rates and licensing, and discovered multiple businesses registered at the same address. After issuing six different notices, three of the businesses failed to comply and were successfully prosecuted.So while Mohamad‚Äôs successfully swapped his financial know-how for expertise in local authority legislation, it‚Äôs his people skills and powers of persuasion he‚Äôs still proudest of.The RoleAs a Data & Intelligence Analyst in our Public Protection and Licensing Unit, you can make your own powerful contribution, by helping us deliver the most effective service that will enhance the lives of our residents and the success of local businesses.As a department, we are focused on playing our part in delivering a Fairer Westminster, where everyone can succeed. You will be at the heart of this work as you undertake a range of skilled data analysis activities that will enable us to make evidence based decisions and deliver a reliably high-quality service.Analysing data relating to criminal activities, disorder and anti-social behaviour, you will maintain, develop and review systems, processes and procedures so that we can provide the most cost-effective service. Taking ownership of small projects and contracts, you will collaborate with colleagues, partners and stakeholders to identify new data sources and tools, and deliver insightful information that will inform operational activities and strategies. You will also provide expertise in relation to existing and emerging risks so that we can identify high risk areas within the borough, and quickly resolve issues.As a highly astute individual with great data manipulation and analysis skills, you will help us come up with practical solutions to complex problems, so you will enjoy interpreting your knowledge and findings for a wide range of audiences.About YouPlease refer to the Job Description for more information.As a member of our inclusive and friendly team, you will find a fantastic working environment in which your opinions and contribution will be greatly valued.To make the most of this great opportunity, you will therefore have a background in using data and intelligence to underpin resource allocation and support senior colleagues in making informed decisions. Crucial to your success will be your ability to work with people from a wide range of departments and teams, so you will have exceptional verbal and written communication skills, with the willingness to collaborate.A degree of flexibility will be needed as you may occasionally be asked to work outside normal hours (such as when you are undertaking inspections or speaking to residents) and you will thrive on helping us deliver tangible results that will benefit local residents and businesses. It would also be helpful if you have previously used geo-spatial analysis software, GiS or Power BI, and an understanding of the Crime and Disorder Act, The Data Protection Act and information sharing would be advantageous.What We OfferWestminster is an amazing place. We are home to more than 200,000 residents from all backgrounds, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people work in Westminster. Westminster City Council‚Äôs strategy is to work towards a Fairer Westminster.

Where people are passionate about keeping our streets safe and clean.Take Mohamad, a City Inspector who looks after the Little Venice ward. No two days are the same for Mohamad when he's out and about conducting ward inspections. He could be doing a licensing premises inspection one day and advising businesses and residents on the proper way to handle their waste on another. But before he joined Westminster, he used to work in banking, where he honed his skills in customer service and people management.And those skills matters because, while he occasionally needs to enforce the law, his job is mostly about building strong relationships: educating businesses and residents about the impact of certain enviro-crimes.One day he came across some unmarked commercial waste dumped on Edgware Road. Following procedures, he investigated this waste, carefully collecting evidence. Yet, despite his attempts to make contact with the commercial premises, the owners wouldn‚Äôt cooperate. Digging deeper, he worked collaboratively with different Westminster departments such as businesses rates and licensing, and discovered multiple businesses registered at the same address. After issuing six different notices, three of the businesses failed to comply and were successfully prosecuted.So while Mohamad‚Äôs successfully swapped his financial know-how for expertise in local authority legislation, it‚Äôs his people skills and powers of persuasion he‚Äôs still proudest of.The RoleAs a Data & Intelligence Analyst in our Public Protection and Licensing Unit, you can make your own powerful contribution, by helping us deliver the most effective service that will enhance the lives of our residents and the success of local businesses.As a department, we are focused on playing our part in delivering a Fairer Westminster, where everyone can succeed. You will be at the heart of this work as you undertake a range of skilled data analysis activities that will enable us to make evidence based decisions and deliver a reliably high-quality service.Analysing data relating to criminal activities, disorder and anti-social behaviour, you will maintain, develop and review systems, processes and procedures so that we can provide the most cost-effective service. Taking ownership of small projects and contracts, you will collaborate with colleagues, partners and stakeholders to identify new data sources and tools, and deliver insightful information that will inform operational activities and strategies. You will also provide expertise in relation to existing and emerging risks so that we can identify high risk areas within the borough, and quickly resolve issues.As a highly astute individual with great data manipulation and analysis skills, you will help us come up with practical solutions to complex problems, so you will enjoy interpreting your knowledge and findings for a wide range of audiences.About YouPlease refer to the Job Description for more information.As a member of our inclusive and friendly team, you will find a fantastic working environment in which your opinions and contribution will be greatly valued.To make the most of this great opportunity, you will therefore have a background in using data and intelligence to underpin resource allocation and support senior colleagues in making informed decisions. Crucial to your success will be your ability to work with people from a wide range of departments and teams, so you will have exceptional verbal and written communication skills, with the willingness to collaborate.A degree of flexibility will be needed as you may occasionally be asked to work outside normal hours (such as when you are undertaking inspections or speaking to residents) and you will thrive on helping us deliver tangible results that will benefit local residents and businesses. It would also be helpful if you have previously used geo-spatial analysis software, GiS or Power BI, and an understanding of the Crime and Disorder Act, The Data Protection Act and information sharing would be advantageous.What We OfferWestminster is an amazing place.
