Dette bekræftes jævnligt ved de løbende medarbejdertilfredsmålinger.Vil du spille en central rolle i at definere og følge op på datakvalitet?Det overordnede formål vil være at sikre effektiv anvendelse af korrekte og relevante data til at støtte forretningen, og det vil du gøre i en virksomhed, hvor der fra alle er en anerkendelse af, at korrekte data og adgang til data er nøglen til succes. Derfor vil du spille en vigtig rolle i at fastsætte parametrene for datakvalitet, finde hullerne i nuværende arbejdsgange med data og stille krav til modellering af data i projekter og det daglige arbejde.

Der er selvfølgelig også noget faglighed, som følger med. Med afsæt i en kandidatuddannelse fra CBS, DTU eller tilsvarende, hvor du både har lært metode, struktur og at modellere data, har du også opnået erfaring med følgende:Data governance, hvor du har en god forståelse for politikker, procedurer, roller og ansvarsområder for effektiv styring og kvalitetssikring af data.Datamodellering og måden, hvorpå data indgår i automatisering af forretningsprocesser.

Og her kommer du ind i billedet. I afdelingen sikrer vi bl.a. en koordineret indsats, når det drejer sig om kontrol af fejludbetalinger og snyd med offentlige ydelser.Vi arbejder desuden med effektivisering af forretningens processer ved brug af teknologier som NLP, LLM, Computer vision og OCR. De seneste år har vi kortlagt et (kæmpe)stort NLP-potentiale på tværs af ATP, og nu arbejder vi på at udvikle og implementere løsningerne, så vi sikrer en effektiv udbetaling.

BioStata ApS,"Birkerød, Capital Region, Denmark",1 week ago,,Senior/Principal statistician,"Could you be our new Statistician? Well, if you:  Are considering a change of scenery.Want a job with a significant degree of influence and variation in the statistical assignments based on customer needs and area of indication. Value working in a flexible environment that are built on the freedom under responsibility principle.  And can see yourself thriving in a small “Professional Family” of 10 other friendly, autonomous and highly skilled colleagues....the answer could actually be a “yes” – and you should definitely consider reading on - and getting in touch with us. Who we are – professionally: We are a Contract Research Organization (CRO) who have specialized in Statistics, Data Management and Statistical Programming – for more than 10 years. We offer all Biometrics services required in relation to clinical and device development. We are located in Birkerød. Who we are – personally: When we founded BioStata in 2010 it was with the clear vision of establishing a company build on a deliberately small team of around 15. This was chosen in order to combine the strength of deep expertise normally found in large organizations – with the flexibility and freedom only found in small companies. Having lived this vision for more than a decade now, we can safely say that some of the keywords describing our working atmosphere are: Trust, helpfulness, open-mindedness, kindness, responsibility, opportunity for influence – and a high degree of professional dedication to what we do. A job in the Life Science industry is often associated with a lot of pressure, hectic deadlines, and stress. At BioStata we deliberately want to take this in a better direction - creating a more meaningful and human-friendly work life and we are - right now - adopting a 4-day a week to explore if this is something that works for us. What your important contribution to the team will be: You have a strong statistical background and broad experience within clinical development. You have a focus on quality and are able to deliver customeroriented solutions, while living up to regulatory requirements. Being a team player is a must, as well as being able to work independently. You will be working together with our other programmers, data managers and statisticians in professional trial teams, where we all benefit from combining decades of knowledge and experience with the bright ideas from the younger members of our professional family. You will be involved – as a part of the trial team – in a great variety of projects, tasks and customers, where the work is carried out at our office, from home or at the customer site, depending on the nature of the task and your preferences. So… are you tempted to join us? Well – at this point you probably have a much better idea of this, than you did just a few minutes ago... If you tend towards “yes” – or if you are curious about getting to know more about us and the position – please contact Tu Duyen Le Thi, Director – Biometrics, tl@biostata.com, tel.: +45 2774 8202 We are looking very much forward to hearing from you – and hopefully welcoming you as part of the team…

Speltestning bygger traditionellt på manuell testning av personal för mänsklig kvalitetssäkring (QA), men syftet här är att utforska möjligheten att använda AI för att ersätta mänskliga spelare med tränade konstgjorda spelare, som kan identifiera buggar och brister, upptäcka och modellera olika användarbeteenden , förutsäg spelarupplevelse och förmedla begripliga UX-rapporter.Inom denna ram värdesätter vi forskningsförslag som sätter fokus på en användarcentrerad design, som enkelt och smidigt integrerar AI-verktygen i ett intuitivt arbetsflöde, vilket gör de utvecklade verktygen tillgängliga för icke-tekniska spelutvecklare och därmed demokratiserar tillgången till ett brett utbud av spelutvecklare till framstegen inom AI för spelutveckling.Detta doktorandprojekt ramas in inom det internationella projektet ""Game Tech Academy"", finansierat av Interreg ÖKS, och kommer att genomföras i samarbete med projektpartners: Aalborg Kommune, Aalborg Universitet, Högskolan i Skövde och Science Park Skövde.

LiveIntent Copenhagen develops and deploys the company's next generation data science and data engineering technology in close collaboration with the company's other departments in New York and Berlin.LiveIntent Copenhagen started as a Danish start-up company in 2013 and was acquired by LiveIntent in November 2015. The team is led by people who have been with us since the start in 2013 and consists of a further approx. 30 new hires that have been added since the end of 2016. There are many exciting tasks are constantly flowing from the rest of the organization to Copenhagen. This team is responsible for the analysis and interpretation of our ad-exchange, which is a suite of complex systems. As we build production systems, we need experience or interest in software development principles or data engineering.About The JobWe are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer for LiveIntent Copenhagen, who has a knack for understanding very complex systems of interaction, and who can analyze issues based on data, and design, develop, and maintain algorithms and software solutions for LiveIntent.

You will be part of all stages of analysis and development: From initial sparring, exchange of ideas and analysis onwards to prototyping, development, testing, deployment, maintenance / improvement and reporting. But with expected heavy focus on analysis, prototyping and development.We believe in flexibility under responsibility, and our development process is therefore a loosely defined hybrid of agile methods and rapid prototyping. We also believe in the ability of the individual to ask for help when blocked and answer the calls of others, so status reporting takes a backseat to development time.Your ProfileYou can be newly educated, have a couple of years of experience with data analysis or software development from other positions, or be very experienced within statistics and data analysis. What is important, is that you are curious, self-driven, and interested in translating real world issues into mathematical models, mathematical statistics, algorithms and computer programs.

You are full of good ideas, able to see opportunities and weaknesses in other people's ideas, and can come up with your own ideas in a constructive way. You love having many issues on your mind and connecting them with data. You understand that finding new facets of data is more important than adjusting meta parameters in algorithms. You are happy to implement and optimize and you are curious about new tasks.You want to understand and involve yourself in the company's problem area and can communicate in English with management and colleagues at the other LiveIntent offices. You are in a dynamic environment where overall priorities and definitions will change over time, and therefore tasks will not always be prioritized. You can hand over tasks, but prefer to follow them to the door itself. You have the ability to work both independently and collaboratively.The CompanyLiveIntent, one of the world’s largest people-based marketing platforms, connects 2,500 publishing and advertising brands with over 250 MM verified people every month across all types of media. With the anonymized email address at the center of its industry-leading identity graph, LiveIntent provides brands with solutions that help them monetize, acquire, and retain real people, even where cookies don’t work. LiveIntent enriches a brands’ data, making it possible for them to deepen their understanding of their audiences, and more effectively market to people wherever they are present and paying attention. LiveIntent is home to over 250 people worldwide with offices in New York, Chicago, Berlin, and Copenhagen.LiveIntent Copenhagen started as a Danish startup company in 2013 and was acquired by LiveIntent in November 2015. We develop and operate both an online, real-time service that receives billions of requests from all over the world and from other LiveIntent components, and an offline, batch-oriented analytical data processing pipeline that prepares data for the online service by processing billions of data points.We offerYou can look forward to being a key player in a challenging and dynamic developmental story where you will be part of a team with some of the industry's best talents. There is a rich opportunity to learn from others, and you will have the flexibility to dive into experiments on your own. We are passionate about new technologies and algorithms, but pragmatic in our choice of solutions.We believe in freedom and flexibility under responsibility. So the office hours can be adjusted, to a relatively large extent, to your life. If you need to work at home one day, it's OK as long as you deliver on your obligations. Likewise, you have a free choice of work machine (Linux, Mac, Windows) and developer tools, but you are expected to be able to debug and maintain them yourself. If you want to introduce a new technology in our stack, it's OK to persuade others to use it.We are an international company, with frequent contact between the departments in Berlin and New York City. The position is a standard position of 37 hours in the office, located in our office in Copenhagen, at Bernstorffsgade 21 in Copenhagen K. Of course, lunch arrangements, telephone / internet and health insurance are included. The position is for occupation as soon as possible.Does that sound exciting? If so, send us an application! We are a small office with a social atmosphere so your personal profile is just as valuable to us as your technical skills. A cover letter will therefore be greatly appreciated.

Factbird,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",2 months ago,,Developing a Scalable MLOps Cloud Infrastructure for Edge Deployment of Vision Machine Learning Models,"Join the Factbird Team and Take Flight into a World of Data Revolution! 🚀At Factbird, we're on a mission to transform data collection and production monitoring, empowering organizations worldwide with the transformative power of data. 🌍💻We're on the lookout for one (or maybe even two!) talented students eager to embark on a thrilling Master's thesis journey with us. If you're studying Computer Science, AI, Software Technology, or related fields at DTU, KU, ITU, or a similar institution, this opportunity could be tailor-made for you.Here are the exciting details:🗓️ Start Date: Ideal kickoff in early 2024 (January or February), depending on your semester schedule.⏳ Duration: The project will align with the scope of your Master's thesis.💫 Project title: Developing a Scalable MLOps Cloud Infrastructure for Edge Deployment of Vision Machine Learning ModelsExecutive Summary:The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has propelled its adoption across various industries, particularly in the realm of computer vision. However, the effective management and deployment of ML models, especially for edge devices, present significant challenges. This thesis project aims to address these challenges by developing a scalable MLOps cloud infrastructure for training, deploying, and evaluating vision ML models in an edge deployment setting.Problem Statement:Traditional MLOps methodologies often lack the flexibility and scalability required for edge deployment, making them less suitable for real-world applications. Current solutions often focus on specific aspects of the ML lifecycle, such as training or deployment, but fail to provide a unified and comprehensive approach. Additionally, the ability for customers to bring their own models (BYOM) further complicates the management and deployment process.Project Objectives:The primary objectives of this thesis project are to:Develop an MVP MLOps cloud infrastructure that seamlessly integrates edge deployment capabilitiesDesign a unified framework for managing the entire ML lifecycle, including training, deployment, evaluation, and monitoringEnable BYOM functionality, allowing customers to easily integrate their proprietary ML models into the platformOptimize the infrastructure for real-time inference on edge devicesTechnical Approach:The proposed MLOps cloud infrastructure will leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, including Amazon Greengrass, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon Lambda, to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and deploying vision ML models. The infrastructure will be designed to efficiently handle multiple tenant workloads, ensuring scalability and availability for edge deployment.Key Deliverables:A detailed MLOps cloud infrastructure architecture that incorporates edge deployment capabilitiesAutomated workflows for training, deploying, evaluating, and monitoring modelsReal-time inference capabilities for edge devicesExpected Outcomes:The successful completion of this thesis project will result in:A robust and scalable MLOps cloud infrastructure for edge deployment of vision ML modelsStreamlined ML lifecycle management processesReal-time inference capabilities on edge devicesEnhanced productivity and efficiency for ML model development and deployment in edge applicationsImpact:The proposed MLOps cloud infrastructure will significantly impact the adoption and utilization of ML models in edge devices. By providing a streamlined and secure solution for model management and deployment, the infrastructure will enable businesses to harness the power of ML for real-time edge applications, such as anomaly detection, image recognition, and object tracking. Additionally, the BYOM functionality will empower businesses to leverage their own proprietary ML models without compromising their intellectual property.A Little About UsFactbird is a game-changing end-to-end manufacturing intelligence solution that simplifies data gathering and analysis for all manufacturers.

LiveIntent Copenhagen develops and deploys the company's next generation data science and data engineering technology in close collaboration with the company's other departments in New York and Berlin.LiveIntent Copenhagen started as a Danish start-up company in 2013 and was acquired by LiveIntent in November 2015. The team is led by people who have been with us since the start in 2013 and consists of a further approx. 30 new hires that have been added since the end of 2016. There are many exciting tasks are constantly flowing from the rest of the organization to Copenhagen. This team is responsible for the analysis and interpretation of our ad-exchange, which is a suite of complex systems. As we build production systems, we need experience or interest in software development principles or data engineering.About The JobWe are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer for LiveIntent Copenhagen, who has a knack for understanding very complex systems of interaction, and who can analyze issues based on data, and design, develop, and maintain algorithms and software solutions for LiveIntent. You are largely able to plan, choose and organize your own tasks, but you are expected to work closely and sometimes jointly with the other developers and with stakeholders in the company's international product division. You will be part of all stages of analysis and development: From initial sparring, exchange of ideas and analysis onwards to prototyping, development, testing, deployment, maintenance / improvement and reporting. But with expected heavy focus on analysis, prototyping and development.We believe in flexibility under responsibility, and our development process is therefore a loosely defined hybrid of agile methods and rapid prototyping. We also believe in the ability of the individual to ask for help when blocked and answer the calls of others, so status reporting takes a backseat to development time.Your ProfileYou can be newly educated, have a couple of years of experience with data analysis or software development from other positions, or be very experienced within statistics and data analysis. What is important, is that you are curious, self-driven, and interested in translating real world issues into mathematical models, mathematical statistics, algorithms and computer programs. It is also important that you are also interested in Machine Learning and/or the AdTech domain and its associated technologies.You have a mathematical education within Computer Science, Mathematics or Physics.You have practical experience with real programming, and practical experience and/or deep theoretical understanding of most of the following:Classical statistics (hypothesis tests, confidence intervals)Data mining and machine learningETL processingRegression modelsDistributed data processing using SparkProgramming in ScalaData analysis and data visualizationAuction mechanismsOptimization methodsYou attack problems analytically and solutions pragmatically. You are full of good ideas, able to see opportunities and weaknesses in other people's ideas, and can come up with your own ideas in a constructive way. You love having many issues on your mind and connecting them with data. You understand that finding new facets of data is more important than adjusting meta parameters in algorithms. You are happy to implement and optimize and you are curious about new tasks.You want to understand and involve yourself in the company's problem area and can communicate in English with management and colleagues at the other LiveIntent offices. You are in a dynamic environment where overall priorities and definitions will change over time, and therefore tasks will not always be prioritized. You can hand over tasks, but prefer to follow them to the door itself. You have the ability to work both independently and collaboratively.The CompanyLiveIntent, one of the world’s largest people-based marketing platforms, connects 2,500 publishing and advertising brands with over 250 MM verified people every month across all types of media.

We develop and operate both an online, real-time service that receives billions of requests from all over the world and from other LiveIntent components, and an offline, batch-oriented analytical data processing pipeline that prepares data for the online service by processing billions of data points.We offerYou can look forward to being a key player in a challenging and dynamic developmental story where you will be part of a team with some of the industry's best talents. There is a rich opportunity to learn from others, and you will have the flexibility to dive into experiments on your own. We are passionate about new technologies and algorithms, but pragmatic in our choice of solutions.We believe in freedom and flexibility under responsibility. So the office hours can be adjusted, to a relatively large extent, to your life. If you need to work at home one day, it's OK as long as you deliver on your obligations. Likewise, you have a free choice of work machine (Linux, Mac, Windows) and developer tools, but you are expected to be able to debug and maintain them yourself. If you want to introduce a new technology in our stack, it's OK to persuade others to use it.We are an international company, with frequent contact between the departments in Berlin and New York City. The position is a standard position of 37 hours in the office, located in our office in Copenhagen, at Bernstorffsgade 21 in Copenhagen K. Of course, lunch arrangements, telephone / internet and health insurance are included. The position is for occupation as soon as possible.Does that sound exciting? If so, send us an application! We are a small office with a social atmosphere so your personal profile is just as valuable to us as your technical skills. A cover letter will therefore be greatly appreciated.

LiveIntent Copenhagen develops and deploys the company's next generation data science and data engineering technology in close collaboration with the company's other departments in New York and Berlin.LiveIntent Copenhagen started as a Danish start-up company in 2013 and was acquired by LiveIntent in November 2015. The team is led by people who have been with us since the start in 2013 and consists of a further approx. 30 new hires that have been added since the end of 2016. There are many exciting tasks are constantly flowing from the rest of the organization to Copenhagen. This team is responsible for the analysis and interpretation of our ad-exchange, which is a suite of complex systems. As we build production systems, we need experience or interest in software development principles or data engineering.About The JobWe are looking for a Data Scientist for LiveIntent Copenhagen, who has a knack for understanding very complex systems of interaction, and who can analyze issues based on data, and design, develop, and maintain algorithms and software solutions for LiveIntent. You are largely able to plan, choose and organize your own tasks, but you are expected to work closely and sometimes jointly with the other developers and with stakeholders in the company's international product division. You will be part of all stages of analysis and development: From initial sparring, exchange of ideas and analysis onwards to prototyping, development, testing, deployment, maintenance / improvement and reporting. But with expected heavy focus on analysis, prototyping and development.We believe in flexibility under responsibility, and our development process is therefore a loosely defined hybrid of agile methods and rapid prototyping. We also believe in the ability of the individual to ask for help when blocked and answer the calls of others, so status reporting takes a backseat to development time.Your ProfileYou can be newly educated, have a couple of years of experience with data analysis or software development from other positions, or be very experienced within statistics and data analysis.

You are full of good ideas, able to see opportunities and weaknesses in other people's ideas, and can come up with your own ideas in a constructive way. You love having many issues on your mind and connecting them with data. You understand that finding new facets of data is more important than adjusting meta parameters in algorithms. You are happy to implement and optimize and you are curious about new tasks.You want to understand and involve yourself in the company's problem area and can communicate in English with management and colleagues at the other LiveIntent offices. You are in a dynamic environment where overall priorities and definitions will change over time, and therefore tasks will not always be prioritized. You can hand over tasks, but prefer to follow them to the door itself. You have the ability to work both independently and collaboratively.The CompanyLiveIntent, one of the world’s largest people-based marketing platforms, connects 2,500 publishing and advertising brands with over 250 MM verified people every month across all types of media. With the anonymized email address at the center of its industry-leading identity graph, LiveIntent provides brands with solutions that help them monetize, acquire, and retain real people, even where cookies don’t work.

So the office hours can be adjusted, to a relatively large extent, to your life. If you need to work at home one day, it's OK as long as you deliver on your obligations. Likewise, you have a free choice of work machine (Linux, Mac, Windows) and developer tools, but you are expected to be able to debug and maintain them yourself. If you want to introduce a new technology in our stack, it's OK to persuade others to use it.We are an international company, with frequent contact between the departments in Berlin and New York City. The position is a standard position of 37 hours in the office, located in our office in Copenhagen, at Bernstorffsgade 21 in Copenhagen K. Of course, lunch arrangements, telephone / internet and health insurance are included. The position is for occupation as soon as possible.Does that sound exciting? If so, send us an application! We are a small office with a social atmosphere so your personal profile is just as valuable to us as your technical skills. A cover letter will therefore be greatly appreciated.

There is an early period where the technology isn't quite working and it doesn't look like it's going to be very useful or important.But then, it reaches a point where the growth accelerates upwards. It moves from the period when it was kind of a crazy idea to a period of excitement and growth.Everything starts working.Image credit: https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.htmlAt Synthesia, we believe the future of media is synthetic. Not sure what's that about?

The banks are working to adapt to the needs of the market, at the same time they are being met with increasing demands for regulation and efficiency. SDC works hard to be at the forefront of the customers’ needs and continue to be the preferred provider of solutions to Scandinavian banks.

I Visma DataLøn og ProLøn hjælper vi danske virksomheder med at effektivisere deres lønadministration med vores forskellige SaaS løsninger. Din fornemmeste opgave bliver at være med til at bygge nye løsninger med gennemtænkt design, ydelse og simplicitet samt testbarhed i din kode. Var du også ved at gå kold i jobannoncefloskler der? 😴 Så er du ikke alene! Hvis du giver os en chance mere, lover vi, at resten af opslaget ikke bliver så tørt og floskelfyldt. Hvem kommer du til at hænge ud med?Du bliver en del af Product Development, som består af en masse skarpe og skønne hjerner 🧠, der hver især bidrager til, at vores produkter er state of the art.Dine nærmeste kollegaer hører til i vores platform team og er 14 styks blandede bolcher fordelt på udviklere og testere. Teamets navn harmonerer ret fint med deres fokus: de arbejder nemlig med platform services på vores nye lønplatform bygget på og med nyeste og lækreste tech stack - naturligvis i clouden. Platformen går live 14. februar i år - og vi glæder os som børn til juleaften til at vise vores mere end end 65.000 kunder, hvad der er blevet udviklet 🙌Kim Borvang vil blive din leder. Kim har rygsækken fyldt med tech-erfaring og er en leder, der har din trivsel og udvikling i fokus.

Her kommer du ind i billedet. Du vil netop skulle designe og deltage i udviklingen af spændende løsninger på vores nye lønplatform.

Vi kunne aldrig drømme om at skrive, at vi forventer, at du har x-års erfaring.

Brand har vi sat en ny og meget ambitiøs kurs med digitalt salg og partnerskaber som helt centralt element. Vores forsikringsprodukter skal kunne sælges og formidles på flere digitale platforme og af partnere som fx VWSF (Audi, VW, Porsche m.fl.) og Sydbank – fuldt integreret i deres digitale platforme.Her er vores store og komplekse TIA-platform det helt afgørende omdrejningspunkt, og det er derfor, vi har brug for dig og din bredt funderede viden på tværs af arkitektur og kode.Videreudvikle- og forbedre kernefunktionalitet samt integrationer i TIA - PL/SQL-kodning Dit overordnede mål er at hjælpe med at løfte vores TIA-platform til næste niveau, som udvikler driver du nye initiativer hele vejen frem til løsningerne er implementeret, og du sikrer med klar kommunikation, at alle er med, både i teamet og blandt involverede interessenter.Vi var en af de første til at implementere TIA, og i dag er vores platform blandt de største i verden. Der er masser af rigtig gode elementer, og der er masser af spændende ting, vi skal tage til det næste niveau.Du kommer til at udfolde dine evner i tværfaglige, agile Squads, der udvikler via 14-dages sprints. Dit arbejde omfatter:At drive nye initiativer fra første idé frem til endelig implementering PL/SQL-udvikling i TIA Videreudvikling af tredjepartsintegrationer, fx til SOS og BBR Deltagelse i brainstorms- og beslutninger om løsningsarkitekturen i platformen Bidrage til vores fortsatte bevægelse mod et DevOps setup inklusive driftsautomatisering, automatiseret test, vidensdeling m.m. Vores tværfaglige Squads består typisk af en Product Owner, Scrum Master, Forretningsspecialist, Forretningsudvikler, Tester samt udviklere fra vores forskellige platforme (CRM/Salesforce, integration, Forsikring/TIA m.fl.). Nøgleordet er tillid. Vi tror således fuldt og fast på, at de enkelte Squads er de bedste til at finde på løsninger, der får teknologi og forretning til at gå op i en højere enhed. Stort ansvar går hånd i hånd med stor indflydelse og personligt impact.Holdspiller med solid TIA/Oracle erfaring og evne til at arbejde bredt Vi leder efter erfarne udviklere, der kan se det overordnede billede, og som har lyst til at bringe ideer frem som den primære TIA-ekspert, både i forskellige Squads og som TIA-ambassadør mere bredt i organisationen.

Da vi er i transformation, skal du trives i et miljø med mange forandringer – vi kender ikke vejen, så vi tilpasser løbende i takt med, at vi bliver klogere.Som udvikler ved du også, hvornår en løsning er god nok til formålet, og du kan således sige stop og komme videre, så vi ikke spilder tiden på detaljer, der reelt ikke gør en positiv forskel. I den sammenhæng kan du udfordre forretningen, hvis en idé kræver unødig megen udviklingstid ift. værdien af løsningen. Det kræver gode kommunikationsevner og herunder evnen til at forklare svært teknisk stof til folk uden din egen ekspertise.Dit CV rummer sandsynligvis:Solid software-udviklingserfaring og herunder flere års erfaring med TIA Erfaring på tværs af udvikling og konfiguration, herunder PL/SQL-udvikling Erfaring med TIA REST og API’er/integrationer Erfaring med Java-udvikling – backend micro services erfaring er et plus, men ikke et krav Erfaring med DevOps, automatiseret test og processer omkring releases og deployment Erfaring med og/eller ønske om at lære mere om løsningsarkitektur Vi tilbyder Bliv en del af den mest spændende transformation i hele Forsikringsbranchen, sammensmeltning af to IT-platforme (Codan og Alm. Brand). Vær iblandt dygtige og dedikerede ildsjæle, som du vil arbejde tæt med i vores agile setup. Bliv hørt og få indflydelse når vi sammen refiner, reviewer og præsenterer opgaverne i scrum squads.Alm. Brand Group tilbyder en lønpakke efter markedsvilkår og kandidatens erfaring.

Kold+Partners,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",1 month ago,,Software Engineer,"A job description is not a job ad. I cannot stress this enough. There is nothing more tiresome than to see an ad like this:Requirements:At least 5 years experience Ability to make swift decisions, work through stressful situations and solve problems quickly Deep knowledge of your area Creativity Ambition etc.Does this make you want to jump up, tell your boss you're leaving and go work for this company instead? I don't think so. This hardly evokes an emotion, much less the feeling of wanting to uproot so much of your being and quit your job.You have to remember that in the end of the day, that's what you want people to do. The people you want to apply are probably being treated really well at their current job so that they won't quit. So, you have to work extra hard to attract them!Ask questions instead of demandingNobody wants to read a list of your demands. If you get a lot of unqualified candidates applying, make sure you use questions to filter them! For example, by asking how many years of experience they have, you will be able to filter the applications, and thus save yourself from reading a lot of unqualified applications.Focus on what you're offeringSince you've just eliminated the need to list your demands, you have a lot of space to write about your company and what you can offer the candidate. Imagine it being a personal ad. You have to really sell the idea of working with you. Write about everything from your lunches together, your flexible hours, free coffee in the break room, etc. When you add these things together, the person reading the ad is going to imagine herself being there with you.Market your companyDon't forget – job seekers are not the only ones reading your ads. Your rivals, customers and partners are probably reading them as well. Job ads are a really good place to see how a company is doing and how generous they can be. When you're writing the ad, make sure to imagine your biggest rival reading the ad. You're going to want to make them jealous, right?Make sure you're not making stuff up!So now you understand the concept of making your company sound like a great place to work. However, you have to be honest. Nothing is worse than a candidate that is disappointed right from the start of an interview. Don't say that you offer something that you don't. Be honest – but be sure to mention everything that makes your workplace a great place to work.Be conciseDon't write too much. To be brutally honest, nobody wants to read about your company for more than two minutes, so make sure that your job ad isn't too long.

Pleo,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",1 week ago,,Senior Security Application Engineer,"Here at Pleo, we're onboarding new customers with Sonic.gif speed, which is amazing don't get me wrong, but the larger we become, the bigger the temptation from cyber criminals. As you may already know, we are in the FinTech business, and we handle money for our customers. So this is not just about protecting a company from a password leak that allows malicious actors to post not-funny cat videos to your SoMe account - this is about directly protecting our customers' money. Well, this is where you (hopefully) come in!This role focuses solely on the application security side. We are talking about both the security side of our application and ensuring our internal dev practices improve our product security maturity. What we're looking for is someone to be part of owning all of this - and to bring the overview and abstraction level when it comes to addressing the topic of application security itself. Our ideal candidate is an AppSec specialist aiming to grow and own the domain.To give you a better idea, here are some tasks you might do as an Application Security Engineer at Pleo.Work within our engineering teams by designing/reviewing technical solutions to address security weaknessesDeep dive into various security subjects related to authentication, encryption and partner integrations Reviewing and understand issues in code, from our managed bug bounty program and providing guidance to developers on how to fix themProvide technical expertise to the GRC and DevOps team in developing and maintaining security automation in the continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipelineJust to make it absolutely clear, we're not building a generalist security team to take over all security-related tasks. We're building a team of specialists to support other teams through paved paths, investigations, and coaching.There will be a lot of flexibility in this role depending on your interests and skills, but as a Staff/Senior you will most likely:Help plan, prioritize, and manage our Application Security roadmap Nurtur and execute projects supporting a long term security vision Continuously think about how we balance automation in controls and process against our defined data classifications while providing access and meeting the needs of the company We'd expect that you are highly skilled in certain areas ideally code review and dynamic testing and not in the whole security-verse. The most important is that you have a passion for the field, you are willing to expand your knowledge, and that you enjoy the responsibilities that come along with such a role.Your profileYou recognize that communication is a core part of your job within application securityYou are pragmatic in your approach to security - and apply the goldilocks principle. You understand that risk drives effort, effort drives cost, not the other way around You agree security isn't sorcery but is a matter of understanding complex systems and applying/recycling creative thinking to interesting problems You love learning new things and enjoy working with problem areas you aren't an expert in (yet) You are honest and unafraid to state things exactly like they are - acknowledging and communicating what's broken is the first step to fixing things The Nitty Gritty SkillsAble to work well with software development teams You are comfortable with server-side languages (we mostly use Kotlin and TypeScript but we know you can learn new languages)You have experience identifying security issues through code review You have strong understanding and experience with common security libraries, security controls, and common security flaws You are known to be a subject matter expert (SME) in at least one technical area impacting the application security of products Nice To Have SkillsJava or Kotlin proficiency and experience with securing applications running on JVM Experience with PCI DSS, GDPR, or PSD2 requirements such as proper network segmentation and authorization mechanism. Maintaining compliance for financial applications like Pleo requires living up to a variety of formal security requirements and completing audits and certifications from time to time Non-requirementsWe don't really care about certificates, degrees, and all that jazz. However, we won't penalize you for talking about your super relevant degree in information security computer science or showing off your brand new certificate. We also don't need you to have x years of experience in information security, but would of course love for you to tell us about any experience that you think is relevant for the job.Show me the benefits!Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending!)Lunch is on us - with catering in our Lisbon, Copenhagen and London offices or a monthly lunch allowance paid directly together with your salary in other markets 🍜Private health insurance to ensure you’re fit in body and mind to do your best workWe offer 25 days of holiday + your public holidaysFlexibility/remote working optionsWellbeing days - fully paid days off designed for a slower pace, allowing you to take time to recharge and prioritise self-careOption to purchase 5 additional days of holiday through a salary sacrificeWe’re trialling MyndUp to give our employees access to free mental health and wellbeing support with great success so far ❤️‍🩹Access to LinkedIn Learning - acquire new skills, stay abreast of industry trends and fuel your personal and professional development continuously Paid parental leave - we want to make sure that we're supportive of families and help you feel that you don't have to compromise your family due to work 👶All of us have a stake in Pleo’s success - ask us about our equity grant scheme#Remote-LIWhy join us?Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries!

Men du behøver hverken skægvækst eller en forkærlighed for visse læskedrikke, for at blive en del af vores team. Tværtimod!Faktisk søger vi dig, der (uagtet køn og kulsyrepræferencer) har lyst til at bruge dine developer-talenter i et ambitiøst og kreativt app-bureau, som hver dag knokler for at skabe elegante, kreative og meningsfulde løsninger til kunder som MENY, AK Nygart, Københavns Universitet m.fl.Og bare rolig, på trods af høje ambitioner og nogle af Danmarks største kunder (vi niver nogle gange os selv i armen), så er vi hverken workaholics eller skruebrækkere. Faktisk prioriterer vi vores fritid så meget, at vi har valgt kun at arbejde 4 dage om ugen. Og selv der er der plads til både fitnesshold og frisørtider, da vi selv bestemmer, hvornår vi lægger arbejdstimerne. Vi tror nemlig ikke på, at kvalitet og kreativitet kan skemalægges til 8-16.

Mustache,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",1 week ago,,Android Developer,"Byg brugeroplevelser til nogle af Skandinaviens største virksomhederLad dig ikke narre af navnet. Mustache er altså ikke bare en flok skæggede mænd i en kælder, der sidder og koder apps og drikker Faxe Kondi dagen lang. Okay, det med apps kan vi nok ikke løbe fra. Men du behøver hverken skægvækst eller en forkærlighed for visse læskedrikke, for at blive en del af vores team. Tværtimod!Faktisk søger vi dig, der (uagtet køn og kulsyrepræferencer) har lyst til at bruge dine developer-talenter i et ambitiøst og kreativt app-bureau, som hver dag knokler for at skabe elegante, kreative og meningsfulde løsninger til kunder som MENY, AK Nygart, Københavns Universitet m.fl.Og bare rolig, på trods af høje ambitioner og nogle af Danmarks største kunder (vi niver nogle gange os selv i armen), så er vi hverken workaholics eller skruebrækkere. Faktisk prioriterer vi vores fritid så meget, at vi har valgt kun at arbejde 4 dage om ugen. Og selv der er der plads til både fitnesshold og frisørtider, da vi selv bestemmer, hvornår vi lægger arbejdstimerne. Vi tror nemlig ikke på, at kvalitet og kreativitet kan skemalægges til 8-16. Nogle dage findes kvaliteten på kontoret kl. 8, andre dage er det på caféen eller i sommerhuset kl. 12.Hvad skal du lave som Android developer (Kotlin) hos Mustache?Helt specifikt leder vi efter en Android Udvikler (Kotlin), der både har erfaringen, selvstændigheden og kreativiteten til at bygge apps op fra bunden, men som samtidig også er fagligt stærk nok til at at overtage og videreudvikle eksisterende apps fra nogle af Skandinaviens største virksomheder.Helt konkret skal du kunne omsætte UX, design og krav-specs til apps skrevet i Kotlin og bygge projekter med MVVM. Og det kan du helt sikkert, hvis du:Har minimum 3 års erfaring med udvikling af native apps til Android (Kotlin).Trives i roller med ansvar og selvstændighedHar god teoretisk forståelse for softwareudvikling, softwarearkitektur og design patterns.Har erfaring med at arbejde selvstændigt på et app-projekt, men også kan være en del af et team med flere udviklere og designere.Er interesseret i både at bygge nye apps fra bunden, samt at videreudvikle eksisterede systemer.Har erfaring med Android SDK'et og Android Studio.Men hvorfor skal du blive en del af Mustache?Vi har meget mere at byde på end vores (ellers yderst velplejede) overskæg.Vi tilbyder nemlig:En arbejdsplads, der prioriterer ekstrem høj kvalitet og æstetik i alt, hvad vi laverArbejdsopgaver, der sætter turbo på din faglige udvikling og gør dig i stand til at udvikle kickass appsEt lederteam der ved, at medarbejderne er mennesker med egne interesser og forpligtelser i deres fritidEt arbejdsmiljø, hvor vi ved, at snakken ved kaffemaskinen (eller i fredagsbaren) kan være lige så værdiskabende som snakken i mødelokaletMulighed for at forme både din egen rolle og fremtid i virksomheden, men også udviklingen af Mustache som virksomhed genereltOg så alt der, vi efterhånden tager som en selvfølge:Kaffe, sodavand og snacks ad libitumFleksible arbejdstider og stederMulighed for en 4 dages arbejdsugeEn lækker frokostordning (selv for den kræsne mave)Løn efter kvalifikationerLyder vi som et bureau for dig?Så vil vi meget gerne invitere på en første kop kaffe (og mange, mange flere, hvis vi ender som et match)

And you are probably a student or just graduated? Very exciting! But first, maybe we should tell you more about what we do and more importantly, why!People claim data is the new oil, so why is it soooo time consuming and complicated to work with? 🤯 Data should be accessible and easy to understand. And that is what we are here to do for the real estate industry. Buildings? Yes, buildings! Those that make up our cities and are an essential part of life, providing the places where we live, work, and relax. Our daily bread is to collect and visualize any type of data that is even remotely relevant to real estate - paving the way for much better decision making. No more gut feelings or spreadsheets 🥱So, in a nutshell, that’s Resights. Or actually not, because what really defines us, are the +40 people behind our software. A collection of nerdy team players who in less than two years have built one of fastest growing startups in Denmark (yes that is true). All while we had fun, because that's truly a part of our DNA 🧬Engineering at Resights 🤓Let us take you inside the Engineering team at Resights.We like to think of ourselves as sympathetic doers. By sympathetic doers, we mean being able to make serious progress super fast without sacrificing being human in the process. We laugh, we have fun, and we know what happens in each others’ lives.The Engineering team is in close collaboration with our Product team. We actually see the two teams as one big team, sharing goals and responsibility. The Engineering team is 12 people strong, divided almost evenly between frontend and backend. Many different backgrounds, and many different nationalities and cultures. We are a team where all opinions are valued and listened to. Best idea wins, that’s how we like to go about it.And now we are looking for a Junior Software Engineer to help us grow and ensure our product scales the next 10 years!About You ⭐️You’re Swedish speaking student or just graduated, and ready and motivated to learn what it takes to bring Resights solutions to your home-country! You want to work directly with the CTO and Co-Founder of Resights and learn the steps of what it takes to build a comprehensive data solution that aggregates and structures vast amounts of data. You currently have a passion for backend services, but are not hesitant to get your hands dirty in all kinds of areas – and most importantly, passionate about how to go from data to value-creation.Past experience 🎓Comfortable with Python programming language.Native Swedish speaker living in Copenhagen.Preferably some experience with AWS.Knowledge of distributed version control, primarily Git.Preferably some familiarity with SQL or NoSQL databases (Postgres or ElasticSearch).Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.Experience in communicating goals, priorities and projects in a comprehensible way.You love 💙Being part of a company with a true building culture. Ship fast, learn, ship again.Striking the balance between speedy and comprehensive solutions, recognizing the appropriate situations for each.Seeing code as a creative force to solve problems and you enjoy navigating through different potential solutions.Working in close collaboration with backend, designers and product managers.Details. Because you know that the devil is in the detail 😈That the best argument wins, no matter who it comes from.Learning. Because there is so much we don’t know. And usually a little bit of research gives you a pretty good idea. At least good enough to move the needle.Asking for forgiveness rather than permission.Other areas than purely code. You have a natural interest in what is best for the business.Resights Tech Stack 💾The frontend stack consists of Vue.js, NuxtJS and Typescript while backend consists of Python leveraging ElasticSearch, Postgres and Redis. Setup deployed in Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The web platform enables product professionals to manage and execute every aspect of their product design, using established robust design disciplines and principles, in a new, fresh, and user-friendly way.The platform is primarily built with TypeScript and runs on Google Cloud. For the front-end, we use React with MUI and Apollo. For the backend, we have a slew of Node services, the primary one being our GraphQL API. We use Prisma as our ORM and Postgres as our database. The 3D analysis service is built with C++ and Python. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform.THE RESPONSIBILITIESYou will join the Platform team as a full-stack engineer working across the React frontend and the Node/GraphQL backend. Your job will be to evolve the platform along with the rest of the team by building exciting new features and iterating on the existing ones. You will be delivering full vertical slices, meaning you get to design, develop, and deliver full features from back to front, which yields a great sense of ownership and investment in the platform. You will actively engage with users and stakeholders to find the best solutions to their problems and desires, and we expect you to help shape the product to the very best it can be.THE SKILLSYou will have many of the following aims, skills, and qualities:Dream of building, developing, and driving for global impact.Communication and collaboration skills to work with cross-functional teams.Experience with TypeScript, React, Node, and GraphQL.Dedication for clean and maintainable code.Keen eye for UI and UX.Proficiency with Git and Git workflows.Attention to detail and a good sense of scalability.Curiosity and eagerness to dive into the domain of Robust Design.Ability to work both collaboratively and independently.Creative and open for new ideas, and work.Bonus points if you have experience with MUI, Apollo, and Prisma.THE FUNDING AND VALIDATIONWe are independent and funded from our existing business. In addition, we have growth financing available, and an option to accept strategic equity investors. In 2023, we further received soft funding, and now have recruited a professional fund-raising team aiming for securing significant EU soft funding in 2024.Earlier this year we were selected to join an AI-development program funded by The Danish Industry Foundation. Later in the year we were selected as one of six out of 100 SMVs to present our AI-aspirations for the annual AI Denmark Award.Having secured an ISO27001 certification is yet another validation of our 2023 endeavours.The Collective is proudest, though, of the validation coming from the global industrial groups already subscribing to our platform following the soft launch in 2023.As our Product Manager you will have an amazing opportunity to help create global impact through enabling these very large companies to create better and more sustainable products.THE RD8. COLLECTIVEThe Collective is a growing team of 35 young’ish software engineers, mechanical engineers, designers, and other clever people. Eight nationalities. English as our go to language.

AXON Networks,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",1 week ago,,Senior Data Scientist,"At AXON Networks, our goal is to support Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in delivering excellent internet and WiFi connectivity to their customers. We build remote monitoring and control tools so that ISPs can identity and resolve issues in their networks early and quickly. We are a trusted strategic partner for our customers, helping them evaluate their current technologies and business models, and creating and executing strategies that enable them to innovate faster, accelerate their digital transformations, and strengthen their relationships with consumers. Ultimately, no customer should ever have to contact their ISP to complain about bad internet service!The AXON Analytics Team is a newly formed team. We exist to bring analytics innovation to the tools we develop for our customers. We are an end-to-end team building full-spectrum analytics. We are building out our team to cover WiFi research, data engineering, data science, machine learning engineering, product analytics and business insights. We deliver analytics in a variety of contexts, from on-demand insights to large-scale, real-time streaming analytics.We are in the early phase of building the team. As such, our job profiles are not totally set in stone - so take the list below as a teaser. The more you tech topics have experience with, the better, of course. And we look forward to hearing about your skills outside of the list: you will drive us forwards in ways we have not yet envisaged. Across the company, we have team members located in Denmark, California, Singapore and two sites in Vietnam, with remote employees at several locations in Europe. The Analytics team is centred in Copenhagen with key roles located there and team members located in Europe.The RoleWe are seeking a Senior Data Scientist to drive forward our analytical data products to be used at scale by our customers. This calls for experience in dealing with high-volume real-time streams of data. While there will be an aspect of explorative data analysis, this role's main responsibility will be to develop, research and ""productify"" solutions that our data research team has identified as having high potential value. The data science team must take ideas from conceptual (PoC) through to a minimal viable product and beyond - all the way to robust solutions deployed in production systems on scalable infrastructure. Of course, that means having model retraining and solution maintainability top-of-mind, as well.Specifically, we are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join the team that has experience in following areas.Classical machine learning methods (clustering, survival analysis, outlier detection, ...), especially for unsupervised methods. Methods for quantifying model performance for unsupervised learning. Enriching sensor data with other data (for example, log data) to get partially labelled data, and semi-supervised learning techniques for building models on such data. Learning on batches of static batches of data to produce models for in-line, real-time predictions. Distributed and federated model training and updates. Methods for monitoring model performance and detecting drift for models in production. Awareness of GenAI approaches and use-cases, ideally some hands-on experience from PoCs/MVPs. Write code for production systems: high quality, using unit tests, version control, .... Work in a hybrid on-prem and cloud environment: experience with both home-built solutions built on open source technology and well as solutions built on commercial off-the-shelf APIs. Additionally, experience with WiFi and internet networking technologies is highly desirable!We work on systems hosted by ourselves (on-prem) as well as in the cloud (GCP, AWS). We work on a mostly open source stack, though we are open to using paid services where there is a clear advantage by doing so. We expect experience in most of the following tools.Classic machine learning stack: Python, notebooks, SQL. Containerised deployments: Docker, Kubernetes. ML Ops tools, for example Kubeflow. Awareness of the following tools is great to have, but not critical.Publishing models as an API. Feature stores, such as Feast. Streaming and pub/sub technologies. We use Apache Pulsar, but experience from other messaging queue systems is great, too. Stream processing methodologies, like Apache Beam or Apache Spark. Java and other OOP languages (such as Go, C++, ...). The Senior Data Scientist role must demonstrate proven experience in delivering production-level analytical solutions. The role will be influential and set the direction for the machine learning components of a solution. There will be close collaboration with software engineering to ensure that the final solution is deployable, scalable and maintainable. The senior role will also take on high responsibility for statistical validation, be it in the form of unit tests or setting guardrails on the output.Job DetailsThe Senior Data Scientist role is on-site (with flexible work from home policy) at our office in Copenagen. There will be an opportunity for some travel, primarily to AXON Network's other office locations.Competitive remuneration package . Health insurance , pension scheme. Flexible work hours and work from home policiy with paid internet. Friendly office environment featuring pool table and gaming corner. Lunch in the office, plus coffee, soft drinks and snacks.

Men du behøver hverken skægvækst eller en forkærlighed for visse læskedrikke, for at blive en del af vores team. Tværtimod!Faktisk søger vi dig, der (uagtet køn og kulsyrepræferencer) har lyst til at bruge dine developer-talenter i et ambitiøst og kreativt app-bureau, som hver dag knokler for at skabe elegante, kreative og meningsfulde løsninger til kunder som MENY, AK Nygart, Københavns Universitet m.fl.Og bare rolig, på trods af høje ambitioner og nogle af Danmarks største kunder (vi niver nogle gange os selv i armen), så er vi hverken workaholics eller skruebrækkere. Faktisk prioriterer vi vores fritid så meget, at vi har valgt kun at arbejde 4 dage om ugen. Og selv der er der plads til både fitnesshold og frisørtider, da vi selv bestemmer, hvornår vi lægger arbejdstimerne. Vi tror nemlig ikke på, at kvalitet og kreativitet kan skemalægges til 8-16. Nogle dage findes kvaliteten på kontoret kl. 8, andre dage er det på caféen eller i sommerhuset kl. 12.Hvad skal du lave som Android developer (Kotlin) hos Mustache?Helt specifikt leder vi efter en Android Udvikler (Kotlin), der både har erfaringen, selvstændigheden og kreativiteten til at bygge apps op fra bunden, men som samtidig også er fagligt stærk nok til at at overtage og videreudvikle eksisterende apps fra nogle af Skandinaviens største virksomheder.Helt konkret skal du kunne omsætte UX, design og krav-specs til apps skrevet i Kotlin og bygge projekter med MVVM.Og det kan du helt sikkert, hvis du:Har minimum 3 års erfaring med udvikling af native apps til Android (Kotlin).Trives i roller med ansvar og selvstændighed Har god teoretisk forståelse for softwareudvikling, softwarearkitektur og design patterns.Har erfaring med at arbejde selvstændigt på et app-projekt, men også kan være en del af et team med flere udviklere og designere.Er interesseret i både at bygge nye apps fra bunden, samt at videreudvikle eksisterede systemer.Har erfaring med Android SDK'et og Android Studio.Men hvorfor skal du blive en del af Mustache?Vi har meget mere at byde på end vores (ellers yderst velplejede) overskæg.Vi tilbyder nemlig:En arbejdsplads, der prioriterer ekstrem høj kvalitet og æstetik i alt, hvad vi laver Arbejdsopgaver, der sætter turbo på din faglige udvikling og gør dig i stand til at udvikle kickass appsEt lederteam der ved, at medarbejderne er mennesker med egne interesser og forpligtelser i deres fritidEt arbejdsmiljø, hvor vi ved, at snakken ved kaffemaskinen (eller i fredagsbaren) kan være lige så værdiskabende som snakken i mødelokaletMulighed for at forme både din egen rolle og fremtid i virksomheden, men også udviklingen af Mustache som virksomhed genereltOg så alt der, vi efterhånden tager som en selvfølge:Kaffe, sodavand og snacks ad libitum Fleksible arbejdstider og stederMulighed for en 4 dages arbejdsugeEn lækker frokostordning (selv for den kræsne mave)Løn efter kvalifikationerLyder vi som et bureau for dig?Så vil vi meget gerne invitere på en første kop kaffe (og mange, mange flere, hvis vi ender som et match)

But first, maybe we should tell you more about what we do and more importantly, why!People claim data is the new oil, so why is it soooo time consuming and complicated to work with? 🤯 Data should be accessible and easy to understand. And that is what we are here to do for the real estate industry. Buildings? Yes, buildings!

You have a natural interest in what is best for the business.Resights Tech Stack 💾The frontend stack consists of Vue.js, NuxtJS and Typescript while backend consists of Python leveraging ElasticSearch, Postgres and Redis.

The web platform enables product professionals to manage and execute every aspect of their product design, using established robust design disciplines and principles, in a new, fresh, and user-friendly way.The platform is primarily built with TypeScript and runs on Google Cloud. For the front-end, we use React with MUI and Apollo. For the backend, we have a slew of Node services, the primary one being our GraphQL API. We use Prisma as our ORM and Postgres as our database. The 3D analysis service is built with C++ and Python. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform.THE RESPONSIBILITIESYou will join the Platform team as a full-stack engineer working across the React frontend and the Node/GraphQL backend. Your job will be to evolve the platform along with the rest of the team by building exciting new features and iterating on the existing ones. You will be delivering full vertical slices, meaning you get to design, develop, and deliver full features from back to front, which yields a great sense of ownership and investment in the platform.

Later in the year we were selected as one of six out of 100 SMVs to present our AI-aspirations for the annual AI Denmark Award.Having secured an ISO27001 certification is yet another validation of our 2023 endeavours.The Collective is proudest, though, of the validation coming from the global industrial groups already subscribing to our platform following the soft launch in 2023.As our Product Manager you will have an amazing opportunity to help create global impact through enabling these very large companies to create better and more sustainable products.THE RD8.

We build remote monitoring and control tools so that ISPs can identity and resolve issues in their networks early and quickly. We are a trusted strategic partner for our customers, helping them evaluate their current technologies and business models, and creating and executing strategies that enable them to innovate faster, accelerate their digital transformations, and strengthen their relationships with consumers. Ultimately, no customer should ever have to contact their ISP to complain about bad internet service!The AXON Analytics Team is a newly formed team. We exist to bring analytics innovation to the tools we develop for our customers. We are an end-to-end team building full-spectrum analytics. We are building out our team to cover WiFi research, data engineering, data science, machine learning engineering, product analytics and business insights. We deliver analytics in a variety of contexts, from on-demand insights to large-scale, real-time streaming analytics.We are in the early phase of building the team. As such, our job profiles are not totally set in stone - so take the list below as a teaser. The more you tech topics have experience with, the better, of course. And we look forward to hearing about your skills outside of the list: you will drive us forwards in ways we have not yet envisaged. Across the company, we have team members located in Denmark, California, Singapore and two sites in Vietnam, with remote employees at several locations in Europe. The Analytics team is centred in Copenhagen with key roles located there and team members located in Europe.The RoleWe are seeking a Senior Software Engineer to ensure our work in Analytics is built on a rock solid software foundation. After all, we build not just for insights and PoCs, but for production. Our ultimate goal is to have well-defined and opinionated software development approaches, so that our team of data scientists and ML engineers can build scalable, robust and maintainable solutions quickly and consistently.Specifically, we are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the team that has experience in following areas.Build integrations from analytical systems to our existing core systems, both upstream and downstream. Manage and be responsible for good CI/CD development processes, including git tagging, to allow analytics team to deploy, test, observe and improve our analytics offering. Establish methodologies for testing and validating integrations to upstream and downstream systems, including validating adherence to SLAs (for example, scaling and latency). Advise data science and ML engineer colleagues on best practices for their own code validation, including unit tests. Work in a pragmatic mircroservice environment: define microservices, communication between them, etc. Work in a hybrid on-prem and cloud environment. We build analytics using typical languages (python, SQL), so we expect familiarity with those. Furthermore, we look for experience in some/most of the following technologies.Java and other OOP languages (such as Go, C++, ...). Streaming and pub/sub technologies. We use Apache Pulsar, but experience from other messaging queue systems is great, too. Stream processing methodologies, like Apache Beam or Apache Spark. Container deployment and orchestration with Kubernetes. ML ops frameworks, such as kubeflow. For the Senior Software Engineer role, we expect proven experience in defining ways of working on all the above mentioned topics. We are a new team, so we are yet to settle on coding guidelines, release strategies (incl. quality gates), and microservice definitions. Further, the role will propose and agree on architectures together with ML Engineer colleagues, to allow us to build a wide range of analytical solutions, ranging from real-time streaming to on-demand analytics, and ETL processing to generative AI products. The Senior Software Engineer will be a strong leader who will establish the Golden Path for analytics, allowing the team of researchers, analysts and data scientists to consistently deliver high-quality software products.Job DetailsThe Senior Software Engineer role is on-site (with flexible work from home policy) at our office in Copenagen.
