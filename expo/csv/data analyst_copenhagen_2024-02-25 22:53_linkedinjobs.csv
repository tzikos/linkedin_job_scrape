Pleo,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",4 days ago,,Senior Security Application Engineer,"Here at Pleo, we're onboarding new customers with Sonic.gif speed, which is amazing don't get me wrong, but the larger we become, the bigger the temptation from cyber criminals. As you may already know, we are in the FinTech business, and we handle money for our customers. So this is not just about protecting a company from a password leak that allows malicious actors to post not-funny cat videos to your SoMe account - this is about directly protecting our customers' money. Well, this is where you (hopefully) come in!This role focuses solely on the application security side. We are talking about both the security side of our application and ensuring our internal dev practices improve our product security maturity. What we're looking for is someone to be part of owning all of this - and to bring the overview and abstraction level when it comes to addressing the topic of application security itself. Our ideal candidate is an AppSec specialist aiming to grow and own the domain.To give you a better idea, here are some tasks you might do as an Application Security Engineer at Pleo.Work within our engineering teams by designing/reviewing technical solutions to address security weaknessesDeep dive into various security subjects related to authentication, encryption and partner integrations Reviewing and understand issues in code, from our managed bug bounty program and providing guidance to developers on how to fix themProvide technical expertise to the GRC and DevOps team in developing and maintaining security automation in the continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipelineJust to make it absolutely clear, we're not building a generalist security team to take over all security-related tasks. We're building a team of specialists to support other teams through paved paths, investigations, and coaching.There will be a lot of flexibility in this role depending on your interests and skills, but as a Staff/Senior you will most likely:Help plan, prioritize, and manage our Application Security roadmap Nurtur and execute projects supporting a long term security vision Continuously think about how we balance automation in controls and process against our defined data classifications while providing access and meeting the needs of the company We'd expect that you are highly skilled in certain areas ideally code review and dynamic testing and not in the whole security-verse. The most important is that you have a passion for the field, you are willing to expand your knowledge, and that you enjoy the responsibilities that come along with such a role.Your profileYou recognize that communication is a core part of your job within application securityYou are pragmatic in your approach to security - and apply the goldilocks principle. You understand that risk drives effort, effort drives cost, not the other way around You agree security isn't sorcery but is a matter of understanding complex systems and applying/recycling creative thinking to interesting problems You love learning new things and enjoy working with problem areas you aren't an expert in (yet) You are honest and unafraid to state things exactly like they are - acknowledging and communicating what's broken is the first step to fixing things The Nitty Gritty SkillsAble to work well with software development teams You are comfortable with server-side languages (we mostly use Kotlin and TypeScript but we know you can learn new languages)You have experience identifying security issues through code review You have strong understanding and experience with common security libraries, security controls, and common security flaws You are known to be a subject matter expert (SME) in at least one technical area impacting the application security of products Nice To Have SkillsJava or Kotlin proficiency and experience with securing applications running on JVM Experience with PCI DSS, GDPR, or PSD2 requirements such as proper network segmentation and authorization mechanism. Maintaining compliance for financial applications like Pleo requires living up to a variety of formal security requirements and completing audits and certifications from time to time Non-requirementsWe don't really care about certificates, degrees, and all that jazz. However, we won't penalize you for talking about your super relevant degree in information security computer science or showing off your brand new certificate.

Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‚Äòmore than you‚Äôd expect‚Äô, and it‚Äôs been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it‚Äôs only fitting that we‚Äôd pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn‚Äôt be siloed from the rest of the organisation ‚Äì they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‚Äòchampion the customer‚Äô, which means we address real pain points that businesses face.
