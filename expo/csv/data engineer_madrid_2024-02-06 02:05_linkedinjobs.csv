Product Hackers,"Alcorcón, Community of Madrid, Spain",4 days ago,,Full Stack - Software Engineer para Growth 🕹️,"🖖🏻 ¡Hola hola desarrolladores/as! 🖖🏻Buscamos a un/a Full Stack Software Engineer que tenga ganas de impulsar la empresa más top de Growth. Te preguntarás, ¿pero qué tendré que hacer en Product Hackers?Aquí trabajamos las tecnologías con fundamento, con un porqué y una lógica detrás. No nos subimos al carro del último hype ni añadimos complejidades innecesarias. Partimos de lo esencial y nos esforzamos por conocer la vanguardia, aunque sea para desecharla si consideramos que no aporta valor a nuestro trabajo. Es decir, sabemos cuándo y cómo usar React, TypeScript o Svelte, pero para ello tenemos que conocer a la perfección HTML, CSS y JavaScript.Nuestro principio básico es que el conocimiento se comparte y la ayuda se brinda, eso es innegociable. Aprenderás de tus compañeros y tus compañeros de ti. El que entra aquí sale siendo muchísimo mejor, independientemente del nivel. Todos tenemos algo que aprender y enseñar.No te vamos a mentir, el nivel de exigencia es muy alto, pero eso es lo que nos ayuda a cada día ser mejores (y es que apuntamos alto, queremos ser los mejores del mundo, ni más ni menos).En nuestro equipo hay astronautas de todo tipo: veteranos con mucho recorrido a sus espaldas, jóvenes prometedores llenos de talento, compañeros que se han ido a otras empresas y han decidido volver a Product Hackers (sí sí, así como te lo cuento 😱)… Muchos podrían estar en otros sitios ganando más dinero o trabajando en lugares que quedan mejor en Instagram ¿Y entonces qué hacen en Product Hackers? Pues algo estaremos haciendo bien. Es que otra cosa no, pero aquí nos gusta cuidar mucho mucho a nuestra gente.Sí, sé que todo esto es difícil de creer, pero te animamos a que si dudas, le preguntes a alguno de nuestros trabajadores si mentimos o no 🤥.Y después de todo este tostón, te lanzamos la pregunta más importante de todas…¿Quieres ser nuestro/a próximo/a astronauta y subir un nivel Product Hackers? 🚀 Si te interesa, sigue leyendo, que te prometemos que lo que viene ahora, te encantará.¿QUÉ BUSCAMOS?Formarás parte de un equipo de producto que desarrolla una solución tecnológica interna que ayuda a escalar nuestro servicio de Growth. Dentro de este equipo, serás uno de los Full Stack Engineers: desarrolladores de producto con habilidades Frontend y Backend que desarrollan funcionalidades para nuestro producto de principio a fin.Buscamos un perfil con una experiencia deseable de al menos 4 años como desarrollador/a Frontend y/o Backend, con foco en producto y mucha inquietud por crecer y meterse en nuevos problemas.¿CUÁLES SERÁN TUS CONTRIBUCIONES? Desarrollar funcionalidades del producto de Experimentor. Refinar a nivel técnico las historias de usuario.  Implementar mejoras técnicas en la base de código Ownership de la entrega de código (puestas en producción, releases...)¿QUÉ TE HARÁ TRIUNFAR CON NOSOTROS?Un mínimo de 4 años de experiencia. Inquietud por el desarrollo de producto con metodologías ágiles. Que conozcas bien cómo se construye y cómo funciona el DOM. En el Frontend trabajamos con React, pero sobre todo necesitamos que conozcas los fundamentos de HTML, CSS y JavaScript, que son la base de nuestro trabajo.Conocer los principios que rigen el buen diseño de APIs y cómo se integran las diferentes piezas de un sistema software. En el Backend también utilizamos Javascript, en este caso Node.js.Que no te asusten las bases de datos, tanto relacionales como NoSQL. Valoramos mucho que sepas escribir una consulta SQL.Que tengas experiencia de desarrollo apoyado en Testing. Que conozcas las metodologías, y que sepas servirte de las mejores tecnologías y buenas prácticas.Experiencia trabajando en equipo con Git. Valoramos que entiendas su funcionamiento interno, y que conozcas los flujos más típicos para manejar ramas y trabajar en equipo (GitFlow, GitHub flow, Trunk based development, etc).Que sepas manejarte con las últimas tecnologías en Inteligencia Artificial y las aproveches para mejorar tu día a día como desarrollador (ChatGPT, Bard, Github Copilot, etc)Nivel de Inglés B1. Que te guste trabajar en equipo, que no te corte pedir ayuda y ofrecerla cuando sea necesario. Somos un bloque, sin individualidades, y los logros y errores se comparten por igual.Que sepas gestionar bien el feedback, tanto darlo como recibirlo.Por encima de todo, que te guste aprender y que compartas tus conocimientos con los demás. Todo lo anterior es totalmente necesario, porque es lo que posibilita que trabajemos como lo hacemos. Sabemos que exigimos mucho, pero apuntamos muy alto y necesitamos contar con gente alineada con nuestros objetivos.ADEMÁS, SERÁ IDEAL SI TÚ…Tienes conocimiento y has trabajado con servicios en la nube (AWS, GCP y/o Azure). Has trabajado con Docker. Tienes conocimientos de metodologías y herramientas de CI/CD. En el equipo trabajamos con GitHub Actions.Estás al día del estado del arte en las últimas tecnologías y frameworks relacionados con el ecosistema Javascript.Si has tenido experiencia en Growth o Marketing Digital, mejor que mejor, pero no es indispensable.Tienes conocimiento de herramientas NoCode, principalmente para gestión de Workflows (Make o Zapier, por ejemplo).Has trabajado con herramientas de analítica web como Google Analytics o Amplitude, o de experimentación como Google Tag Manager, Optimizely o VWO. Si no las conoces las aprenderás aquí dentro porque las usamos a diario.Puedes incorporarte al equipo lo antes posible.¿CÓMO SERÁN TUS PRIMEROS MESES EN PRODUCT HACKERS? El primer mes 📅: Tienes experiencia en desarrollo de software y no queremos que te enfríes, así que harás un commit a producción durante tu primera semana. Si puede ser incluso el primer día. Además de esto, aprenderás el funcionamiento de Product Hackers como negocio.

Además habrás tenido la oportunidad de compartir tus conocimientos con los compañeros del área de ingeniería a través de sesiones técnicas y formaciones impartidas por ti. A la luna 🚀: Tendrás ownership de una parte del desarrollo del producto, y podrás desarrollarte en Product Hackers tanto de manera profesional como personal. En este marco tendrás un plan de desarrollo de carrera que te garantice la progresión dentro de la compañía. Queremos que estés mucho tiempo con nosotros.
