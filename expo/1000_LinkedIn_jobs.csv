                Our mission at DRONAMICS is to democratize air freight and enable same day shipping for everyone, everywhere. To achieve this, we are developing a new type of cargo airplane, one that is small, remotely-piloted and extremely fuel efficient. It can transport up to 350 kg over 2,500 km for a cost that's 50% lower than other airplanes. It flies autonomously, can be monitored and managed remotely via satellite, and can land and take off anywhere with at least 400m of landstrip This is the kind of technology that can transform whole economies.<p><br>
</p>At first, it didn't sound possible, but we keep proving it is, which is why we've called it “The Black Swan”.

</p>We are starting with domestic air networks in Europe and Australia with fleets of the Black Swan, taking advantage of the multitude of small airfields that are often unused, training local personnel as drone and logistics operators, and partnering with local industry to provide a valuable lifeline of getting goods in and out of small, remote, mountainous and/or island communities within hours at a cost that is often below even that of road transportation.<p><br>

Our aim is to leverage cutting-edge Technology in order to provide the optimum experience to those who trust us for their entertainment.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p><p>Principal Engineers hold a central role in the Technology department. They are expected to help teams devise elegant and performant solutions in response to real business problems, guide them in designing and implementing these solutions in code, as well as teach coding, testing, debugging, and performance analysis techniques, while also carrying out code reviews.</p><p>Principal Engineers will frequently attend the team’s scrum events (esp. refinements) and help the team’s product owners shape a better understanding of the technical challenges involved. Production problems are usually escalated to the Principal Engineers, for triaging before landing in a team's backlog. Principal Engineers should also stay up to date on the latest technologies and drive their adoption.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p>At Kaizen, we operate in verticals, which represent the connection with our customers and the way that we are creating sustainable growth and seamless entertainment experiences.

The technology department is organized across tribes with each tribe focusing on a particular aspect of the business. Each tribe is led by its tribe-leader, who reports to the Vertical Director. Tribes are composed of teams and an architect may lead one or more of them.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>Tech Stack</strong></p><p>Our tech stack consists of many services and applications written in C#/.NET (both full framework and Core) for the backend stuff.</p><p>We use jQuery/Knockout.js for some of the older apps and Angular or Vue.js for the newer front-end stuff. We use MSSQL server and PostgreSQL for most of our storage needs interspersed with Redis and ElasticSearch, whenever it makes sense to do so. RabbitMQ is the message broker ubiquitously used in our systems and we deploy using a mixture of regular good old VMs and Docker containers on our on-prem Openshift installation. We're using git and Gitlab for version control and our CI/CD pipeline. We use the latest versions of our frameworks. </p><p><br>

Our aim is to leverage cutting-edge Technology in order to provide the optimum experience to those who trust us for their entertainment.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p><p>Principal Backend Engineers hold a central role in the Technology department. They are expected to help teams devise elegant and performant solutions in response to real business problems, guide them in designing and implementing these solutions in code, as well as teach coding, testing, debugging, and performance analysis techniques, while also carrying out code reviews. Will frequently attend teams' scrum events (esp. refinements) and help teams' product owners shape a better understanding of the technical challenges involved. Production problems are usually escalated to Principal Engineer for triaging before landing in a team's backlog. Principal Engineers should also stay up to date on the latest technologies and drive their adoption.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>Culture</strong></p><p>Principal Backend Engineers across tribes cooperate with each other, aligning frequently among themselves and helping each other from designing new systems to filling in gaps in their business knowledge and everything in between. We strongly believe in coaching and being proactive. Principal Engineers will pair program with members of their teams, offering hands-on advice and addressing problems much sooner than code review time. We are proud of building an experienced and talented Principal Engineers team that everybody will be eager to join. But at the same time, we would like to make sure we engage kind and friendly personalities with leadership qualities, who can foster trust and personal growth among their peers.</p><p><br>

Each vertical (Sportsbook, Gaming, Account &amp; Services, Rewards &amp; Comms), as well as our core technology lines (Platform and International Expansion), consists of Technology and Product teams. Our Technology department is organized across tribes with each tribe focusing on a particular aspect of the business. Each tribe is led by their tribe-leader, who reports to the Vertical Director. Tribes are composed of teams and an architect may lead one or more of them. Principal Engineers, depending on the tribe, can report to Technology Managers or Tribe Leaders.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>Tech stack</strong></p><p>Our tech stack consists of many services and applications written in C#/.NET (both full framework and Core) for the backend stuff. We use jQuery/Knockout.js for some of the older apps and Angular or Vue.js for the newer frontend stuff. We use MSSQL server and PostgreSQL for most of our storage needs interspersed with Redis and ElasticSearch, whenever it makes sense to do so. RabbitMQ is the message broker ubiquitously used in our systems and we deploy using a mixture of regular good old VMs and Docker containers on our on-prem Openshift installation. We're using git and Gitlab for version control and our CI/CD pipeline.</p><p><br>
</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>Must have:</p><ul><li>7+ years of working as a software engineer at least some of which for high traffic websites;</li><li>Current and up-to-date software engineering skills;</li><li>Good people skills;</li><li>Team player; analytical thinker and problem solver; ability to self-organize;</li><li>Fast learner- you will need to get up to speed on business, people and teams, infrastructure and the technologies used as quickly as possible.</li></ul><p>Nice to have:</p><ul><li>Experience in coding in C#;</li><li>Familiarity with functional programming, distributed architectures and eventually consistent systems.</li></ul><p><br>

<br>
Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.<br>

<br>
Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.<br>
<br>
It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.<br>
<br>
<strong><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion<br>
<br>
</strong></strong>Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.<br>
<br>
We’re so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, and it’s really important to us that it stays that way. That means whatever your race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.<br>

                <p>PNOĒ enables health professionals to provide science-backed nutrition and training through breath analysis. For 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in longevity assessment, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical organs (i.e.heart, lungs, cells). Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first clinical-grade metabolic analyzer for mass usage and a proprietary software package that analyzes the human breath, detects health conditions and prescribes personalized programs. Through the PNOĒ ecosystem, any doctor, gym, or health-related business can provide the most advanced nutrition and health optimization program possible without any training, hiring, or upfront cost. </p><p><br>
</p><p>PNOĒ is trusted by 3,000+ health professionals, world-class athletes such as Russel Wilson (NFL champion), Emma Raducanu (US Open champion), and Annie Thorisdottir (Crossfit Games champion), 100+ research centers and universities, as well as leading brands including WHOOP and Spartan Racing. </p><p><br>
